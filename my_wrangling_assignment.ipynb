The sentence \"Like families, tidy datasets are all alike but every messy dataset is messy in its own way” means that tidy datasets provide a way to link the structure of a dataset with its meaning. The sentence \"For a given dataset, it’s usually easy to figure out what are observations and what are variables, but it is surprisingly difficult to precisely define variables and observations in general.\" means that it is easy to pinpoint the observations and variables of the data, but defining the variables and observations to make the data more specific and tidy is hard to do.\n",

The five most common problems are that column headers are values, not variable names, multiple variables are stored in one column, variables are stored in both rows and columns, multiple types of observational units are stored in the same table, and a single observational unit is stored in multiple tables. The data in Table 4 is messy because there are variables in both the rows and columns and the column headers are values, not variable names. Melting a dataset turning columns into rows.\n",
